 * This class is immutable, but fields are set outwith the constructor. Notice that the private field setter method is
 * only called from within the constructor, and while it does modify the fields, no changes to the instance can be
 * viewed by clients of the class.
 * 
 * This pattern can occur with serialisation of an immutable object.
 * 
 * Several examples were found within JodaTime.
