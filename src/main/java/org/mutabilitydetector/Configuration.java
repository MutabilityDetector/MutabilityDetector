     * such, calling this method will have no effect when querying an

     * <p>
     * During analysis, an exception may occur which is recoverable. That is,
     * Mutability Detector is able to continue it's analysis, and <b>may</b>
     * produce valid results.
     * <p>
     * Setting this configuration flag to {@link ExceptionPolicy#FAIL_FAST},
     * will cause any unhandled exceptions will propagate, causing a failing
     * test or aborting a command line run.
     * <p>
     * Setting this configuration flag to {@link ExceptionPolicy#CARRY_ON} may
     * allow analysis to function where exceptions don't necessarily preclude a
     * useful output. For example, consider a class which you wish to make
     * immutable; a test for that class fails with an unhandled exception. If
     * that test has, say 10 reasons for mutability, and 1 of those causes the
     * test to abort with an exception, you have just lost out on 90% of the
     * required information. {@link ExceptionPolicy#CARRY_ON} will allow the
     * test to report 9 out of 10 reasons. The test may be useful, although it
     * won't be comprehensive.
     * <p>
     * 
     * If you are unlucky enough to have a class which causes exceptions during
     * analysis, please report it to the Mutability Detector project, at the <a
